# plotting-polar-field

Throughout an 11-year solar cycle, the Sun's [magnetic field flips](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/mbobra/plotting-polar-field/blob/master/plot_polarfield_d3.ipynb) and [active regions migrate](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/mbobra/plotting-polar-field/blob/master/butterfly.ipynb) from mid to low latitudes. Here is an example that shows the evolution of the magnetic field at the solar surface -- as observed by two different satellites, NASA's [Solar Dynamics Observatory](http://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/) and NASA/ESA's [Solar and Heliospheric Observatory](https://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/), over 24 years (roughly two solar cycles):

In these notebooks, you can interactively browse through years of solar magnetic field data; you can also view these visualizations at the [Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager Polar Field website](http://jsoc.stanford.edu/data/hmi/polarfield/).  These notebooks plot data using [mpld3](https://mpld3.github.io/) and [altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/), both Python libraries for data visualization. Both these libraries build upon [D3](http://d3js.org/), a JavaScript library for data visualization.
