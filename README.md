plotting the polar field (python + d3)

The Sun's magnetic field flips every 11 years. In 2014, we observed such a flip. Using this ipython notebook, you can interactively browse through years of solar magnetic field data to determine exactly when the flip occurred. This notebook plots data from NASA's [Solar Dynamics Observatory](http://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/) using [mpld3](https://mpld3.github.io/), which is a python interface for [d3](http://d3js.org/).
